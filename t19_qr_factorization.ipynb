    "# Introduction \n",
    "In linear algebra, a QR factorization of a matrix is a factorization of a matrix A into a product $A = QR$ of an orthogonal matrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R. QR factorization is often used to solve the linear least squares problem and is the basis for a particular eigenvalue algorithm, the QR algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q in the QR factorization will be unitrary (orthogonal when dealing with real numbers). What this means is that $Q^H Q = I$. Additionally it will be shown that $QR$ does yield A.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key benefits of using QR factorization over other methods for solving linear least squares is that it is more numerically stable, albeit at the expense of being slower to execute. Hence if we are performing a large quantity of regressions as part of a trading backtest, for instance, we need to consider very extensively whether QR factorization is the best fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Methods for Computing the QR factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculating the QR matrix using Householder transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "For a square matrix A the QR factorization converts A into the product of an orthogonal matrix Q (i.e. $QTQ=I$) and an upper triangular matrix R. Hence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A=QR$\n",
    "The first step is to create the vector x, which is the k-th column of the matrix A, for step k. We define $α=−sgn(xk)(||x||)$ where sgn is the sign operator. The norm $||⋅||$ used here is the Euclidean norm. Given the first column vector of the identity matrix, I of equal size to A, $e1=(1,0,...,0)^T$, we create the vector u:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u=x+αe1$\n",
    "Once we have the vector u, we need to convert it to a unit vector, which we denote as v:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v=u/||u||$\n",
    "Now we form the matrix Q out of the identity matrix I and the vector multiplication of v:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q=I−2vvT$\n",
    "Q is now an m×m Householder matrix, with $Qx=(α,0,...,0)T$. We will use Q to transform A to upper triangular form, giving us the matrix R. We denote Q as Qk and, since k=1 in this first step, we have Q1 as our first Householder matrix. \n",
    "Hence, we define Qk as the block matrix $Q_{k}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "I_{k-1} & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & Q_{k}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q_{k}=(I_{k}−100Q′_{k})$\n",
    "Once we have carried out t iterations of this process we have R as an upper triangular matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$R=Q_{t}...Q_{2}Q_{1}A$\n",
    "Q is then fully defined as the multiplication of the transposes of each Qk:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q=Q^{T}_{1}Q^{T}_{2}...Q^{T}_{t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives $A=QR$, the QR factorization of A.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gram-Schmidt and modified Gram-Schmidt algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is the most poorly numerically conditioned method of those highlighted here, however it is also the least computationally intensive method of calculating the QR factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gram-Schmidt method creates an orthonormal basis to span the columns of A. This orthonormal basis can be used to create an upper triangular R matrix and by extension a unitary Q matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Givens rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Givens rotations are similar to householder transformations, but they zero out individual elements of the matrix one at a time instead of zeroing out portions of columns all at once. Additionally, givens rotations can be implemented using CORDIC rotations which allows the solution to be parallelized and pipleined. Carefully selected rotations can aid in simplifying computational complexity, by ensuring that mulitplications are powers of 2 and that fewer multiplications need to be done.\n"

    "In numerical analysis, different factorization are used to implement efficient matrix algorithms. For instance, when solving a system of linear equations , the matrix A can be factorized via the LU factorization. The LU factorization factors a matrix into a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U. Solving the system will require fewer additions and multiplications in the LU factorization, though one might require significantly more digits in inexact arithmetic such as floating point.\n",
    "Similarly, the QR factorization expresses A as QR with Q a unitary matrix and R an upper triangular matrix. The system $Q(Rx) = b$ is solved by $Rx = Q^{T}b = c$, and the system $Rx = c$ is solved by 'back substitution'. The number of additions and multiplications required is about twice that of using the LU solver, but because the QR factorization is numerically stable, no additional significant digits are required in inexact arithmetic."
